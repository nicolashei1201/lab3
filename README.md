Question A:
use g++ to compile my question
Question B:
if you use sort that is already in the lib.algorithm,it would be faster since it can compute through more efficient ways.Such as parallal computing.
On the other side,if you use the insertion sort that wrote by yourself,it would be much slower since it would have to compute the varibles one by one.
